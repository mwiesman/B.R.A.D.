# B.R.A.D.
Brad's Readily Accessible DAW

----------------------
Intro
----------------------
In order to help our friend Brad reconnect with his musical skills, we developed a plug-in that can be run as a standalone musical interface. The intent of this application is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows aspiring musicians to access a variety of audio recording and editing features. The plug-in was built using C++ and HISE/JUCE.


-------------------------------
Getting Started
---------------------------------
To launch the B.R.A.D. plug-in sampler:
```
1. Get the code: clone or download our git hub repo to your local machine. Save it somewhere you will be able to access it.
2. Open the app: from the main project folder, launch the file 'Tutorial.app'. 
3. Find samples: upon the initial launch, the app will prompt you to locate the Samples folder. Click "Choose Sample Folder", navigate to the project folder, open 'HISE', select 'Samples, and then click 'Open'.
(Trouble-shooting: if you run into a subsequent error message or are unable to hear any audio, try closing and reopening the app.)
4. Play away!
```
