# B.R.A.D.
Brad's Readily Accessible DAW

----------------------
Intro
----------------------
In order to help our friend Brad reconnect with his musical skills, we developed a plug-in that can be run as a standalone musical interface. The intent of this application is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows aspiring musicians to access a variety of audio playing, recording and editing features. The plug-in was built using C++ and JS with the HISE/JUCE framework.


-------------------------------
Getting Started
---------------------------------
To launch the B.R.A.D. plug-in sampler:
```
1. Get the code: clone or download our git hub repo to your local machine. Save it somewhere you  
will be able to access it.
2. Open the app: from the main project folder, launch the file 'Tutorial.app'. 
3. Find samples: upon the initial launch, the app will prompt you to locate the Samples folder.  
Click "Choose Sample Folder", navigate to the project folder, open 'HISE', select 'Samples, and then  
click 'Open'. (Trouble-shooting: if you run into a subsequent error message or are unable to hear  
any audio, try closing and reopening the app.)
4. Play away!: either click on the virtual keyboard using a mouse or press keyboard buttons to  
create music.
```

----------------------
Utilizing the Plug-in
------------------------
In order to get the most out of you very own B.R.A.D. plug-in:
```
1. Reverb: drag this knob to a higher value to increase reverb or "echo" effect.
2. Octave Control: click this button to play on a higher octave.
3. Volume: the volume to your input should be visible in the two bars in the upper right hand corner.
4. MIDI Activity LED: a small icon in the upper left-hand corner should light up upon connecting a  
MIDI device to your machine (Coming soon).
